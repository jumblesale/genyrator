Feature: performing operations on a simple schema

  Background:
    Given I have an entity "BookStore" with properties
    | name         | type     | nullable |
    | book_name    | str      | False    |
    | publish_date | date     | False    |
    | in_stock     | int      | False    |
    | rating       | float    | True     |
    And identifier column "book_id" with type "int"
    And I create a schema "books" from those entities
    And the app is running
    And I have json data
    """
    {
      "id": 3,
      "bookName": "the dispossessed",

  Scenario: requesting a non-existing entity
     When I make a "GET" request to "/book-store/1"

  Scenario: creating a new entity with correct data

     Then I get http status "201"
      And I can get entity "/book-store/3"

  Scenario: creating an entity with non-dict data
